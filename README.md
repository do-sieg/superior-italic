# Superior Italic

A JavaScript Library to handle italic without going through CSS (because people never remember where to find that stupid property).

To use the lib, be sure to import it in your HTML files.
Wrap any text with the `<i></i>` tag. The script will handle the rest.

See the example HTML page.

_Note: I made sure to remove the default CSS italic property from the i tag so you could use this superior version._

## Styling a text with italic

```html
<i>text</i>
```

## Changing the angle

You can use **data-angle** to change the angle.

```html
<i data-angle="45">text</i>
```

Negative values can be used.

```html
```<i data-angle="-45">text</i>```
```

## Compatibility

This is compatible with any plain HTML/CSS/JS project.

I'd adapt it for React but the joke overstayed its welcome already.
